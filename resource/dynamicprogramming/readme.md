The Fibonacci sequence pattern is useful when the solution to a problem depends on the solutions of smaller instances of the same problem.

There is a clear recursive relationship, often resembling the classic Fibonacci sequence F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).

## 3. 0/1 Knapsack

The 0/1 Knapsack pattern is useful when:

    You have a set of items, each with a weight and a value.

    You need to select a subset of these items.

    There's a constraint on the total weight (or some other resource) you can use.

    You want to maximize (or minimize) the total value of the selected items.

    Each item can be chosen only once (hence the "0/1" - you either take it or you don't).

    You can select each item multiple times (unlike 0/1 Knapsack where each item can be chosen only once).

    The supply of each item is considered infinite.
