# Divide and Conquer Problems

1. **[Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/)**
   - Convert a sorted array into a height-balanced binary search tree (BST). The BST should have minimal height.

2. **[Sort List](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/)**
   - Sort a linked list in O(n log n) time complexity using the merge sort algorithm.

3. **[Construct Quad Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-quad-tree/)**
   - Given a 2D grid of 0s and 1s, construct a quad tree representation of the grid.

4. **[Merge k Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)**
   - Merge k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list, utilizing the divide and conquer approach for efficiency.
